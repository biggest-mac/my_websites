back to <a href="index.html">mackenzivault</a>

  my effort is put towards creating systems that sustain me, systems that support me and my fluctuations. 
  it is my mission to become more resiliant, more autonomous, more free; to be this way requires discipline
  i am an aspiring newton machine, a self sustaining system; i generate my own energy using my free will. 
  the choices i make reverberate and echo through my systems.
