ryan mackenzi (she/they)
  
- I am a collector of various things
- I am a weave-togetherer of wild truths
- I am a seeker-finder of meaning, gleaned from (not so) random digging in (one day) archaeological sites
- I am a pile maker, a stacker, a sorter. a sifter
- I am a recorder and a player
- I am a feedback loop
- something something natural cycles, the moon

Defining my practice is difficult, mostly because I didn't think of myself as having a practice until very recently. I find it difficult to notice the overarching themes of my work. Is it my ADHD, my dissociative habits my anxiety? But when I allow myself the opportunity to face my work, I am met with my own obsessions. I am stuck in the past 

I like to find accidental meaning, following my intuition and natural instincts. Like in spiritual rituals, I go towards what resonates. Often I browse piles, collections, Stuff. And some of these objects have a gravity to them. When I let myself be drawn in, I'm usually met with something serendipitous. When I experience synchronicities I feel as if I am on the right track. 

A lot of my time is consumed by shame. It is a very easy emotion-state to drop into, and became indistinguishable from my identity for most of my life. Inhabiting multiple identities that we are told are opposites, or seeking acceptance and belonging from a society that doesn't care if i survive.

Escaping reality, into fantasy

my effort is put towards creating systems that sustain me, systems that support me and my fluctuations. 
it is my mission to become more resiliant, more autonomous, more free; to be this way requires discipline
i am an aspiring newton machine, a self sustaining system; i generate my own energy using my free will. 
the choices i make reverberate and echo through my systems. bleeding, bleeding, bleeding...

my work explores shame, memory, legibility, identity, inheritance...
